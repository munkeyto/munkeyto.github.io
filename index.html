    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>This is is a blank canvas for me to practice basic web dev, and share my projects to the outside world. Below is a picture of one of my cats.</p>

    <p>Below is an image of a random dog giving you the "Ruh Roh" eyes. Isn't it cute?</p>

    <img src="images/uh-dog.avif" width="50%" height="50%" alt="ruh roh">

    <p>When not building epic sites like this I spend my time working as a Product Marketing duder in the games industry and like Anime, Manga and other things.</p>
   
    <p>Cheers!</p>
